              ducky started as a weekend project to solve a simple problem: sharing a local server with a teammate shouldn't require a deployment.

            <h2>Our story</h2>
            <p>
              Every developer has been there — you've built something locally, it works perfectly on your machine,
              and now you need to show it to someone else. Or a third-party webhook needs to reach your
              development server. Or you're demoing to a client from a coffee shop.
            </p>
            <p>
              The workarounds were clunky: deploy to a staging server, fiddle with port forwarding,
              or pay for a VPN just to share a URL. ducky was built to make that entire class of problem disappear.
              One command, one URL, done.
            </p>
            <p>
              We're a small team of developers who use ducky ourselves every single day. That keeps us honest —
              every bug we ship, we feel. Every performance win, we celebrate.

            <h2>Open and honest</h2>
            <p>
              We believe in transparency. Our pricing is straightforward — no surprise bills, no
              features gated behind obscure tiers. If something breaks, we tell you what happened
              and what we're doing to fix it.
            </p>
            <p>
              We're also believers in the open web. ducky speaks standard HTTP and WebSockets.
              It works with any framework, any language, any stack. No lock-in.
