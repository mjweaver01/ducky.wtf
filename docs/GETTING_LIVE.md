# Step-by-step: Get ducky live on Railway

This guide walks through deploying the full ducky stack to Railway so it's live with HTTPS and database-backed authentication.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Railway account** at [railway.app](https://railway.app) — Hobby plan ($5/month base) is sufficient to start; wildcard custom domains require Pro plan ($20/month).
- **Domain** you control (e.g. `ducky.wtf`). You'll add DNS records in a later step.
- **GitHub repo** — Railway deploys from Git.
- **Railway CLI** (optional but useful): `npm install -g @railway/cli`

---

## Step 1: Create a Railway project

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app) → **New Project**.
2. Choose **Empty project**.
3. Name it `ducky`.

---

## Step 2: Add PostgreSQL

Inside the project, click **+ New** → **Database** → **Add PostgreSQL**.

Railway will provision a managed Postgres instance and automatically make `DATABASE_URL` available to any service you link it to.

Run the schema once the database is ready:

```bash
# Using the Railway CLI
railway connect postgres
# Then in the psql prompt:
\i database/schema.sql
```

Or use the Railway dashboard → **PostgreSQL** → **Data** → **Query** tab and paste the contents of `database/schema.sql`.

---

## Step 3: Create the services

With GitHub integration, Railway may create a service per package. You only need **three services**: server, web-backend, web-frontend. **For each of those, set Dockerfile path and leave Root directory empty** (build context must be repo root).

| Railway service (package name) | Dockerfile path |
|---|---|
| `@ducky/server` (tunnel server) | `Dockerfile` |
| `@ducky/web-backend` | `Dockerfile.web-backend` |
| `@ducky/web-frontend` | `Dockerfile.web-frontend` |

If Railway created services for `@ducky/cli` or `@ducky/database`, **delete them** — the CLI is for local use, and the real database is the Postgres plugin.

For each service below, click **+ New** → **GitHub Repo** (or **Empty Service** if you prefer to push via CLI), then configure as shown.

### 3a. tunnel-server (@ducky/server)

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Config file path | `/railway.server.toml` |
| Root directory | empty |

**Environment variables** (set in Railway dashboard → service → Variables):

```
BASE_DOMAIN=ducky.wtf
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
```

`DATABASE_URL` is auto-injected when you link the Postgres service — click the service → **Variables** → **+ Add Reference** → select `DATABASE_URL` from the Postgres plugin.

### 3b. web-backend (@ducky/web-backend)

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Config file path | `/railway.web-backend.toml` |
| Root directory | empty |

**Environment variables**:

```
NODE_ENV=production
WEB_PORT=3002
JWT_SECRET=<generate a strong random secret>
SESSION_SECRET=<generate a strong random secret>
WEB_URL=https://ducky.wtf
```

Link `DATABASE_URL` from the Postgres plugin (same as above).

### 3c. web-frontend (@ducky/web-frontend)

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Config file path | `/railway.web-frontend.toml` |
| Root directory | empty |

**Environment variables** (used as Docker build args):

```
VITE_API_URL=https://api.ducky.wtf
```

> Railway passes environment variables as build args when you set them as variables on the service. The `Dockerfile.web-frontend` accepts `VITE_API_URL` as a build arg.

---

## Step 4: Assign custom domains

In Railway, go to each service → **Settings** → **Networking** → **Custom Domain**.

| Service | Domain |
|---|---|
| `tunnel-server` | `*.ducky.wtf` (wildcard — requires Pro plan) |
| `web-backend` | `api.ducky.wtf` |
| `web-frontend` | `ducky.wtf` |

Railway will show the CNAME target for each domain after you add it.

> **Note on the wildcard**: Railway Pro plan is required for wildcard custom domains. Without it, individual tunnel subdomains like `abc123.ducky.wtf` won't route to the tunnel server.

---

## Step 5: Update DNS records

At your DNS provider, create the CNAME records Railway shows you:

| Name | Type | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `*.ducky.wtf` | CNAME | Railway tunnel-server domain |
| `api.ducky.wtf` | CNAME | Railway web-backend domain |
| `ducky.wtf` | CNAME (or ALIAS) | Railway web-frontend domain |

Railway automatically provisions TLS certificates via Let's Encrypt once DNS propagates (usually a few minutes).

---

## Step 6: Verify the deployment

**Web UI:**
```
https://ducky.wtf  →  should load the React app
```

**API health:**
```bash
curl https://api.ducky.wtf/health
# {"status":"healthy","database":"connected",...}
```

**Tunnel server metrics:**
```bash
curl https://tunnel.ducky.wtf/metrics
# {"activeTunnels":0,...}
```

---

## Step 7: Configure the CLI and start a tunnel

1. Create an account at `https://ducky.wtf` and generate an auth token in the dashboard.
2. Configure the CLI:

```bash
ducky config auth YOUR_TOKEN
ducky config add-server-url wss://tunnel.ducky.wtf/_tunnel
```

3. Start a tunnel:

```bash
ducky http 3000
# Tunnel established: https://abc123.ducky.wtf -> localhost:3000
```

---

## Step 8: Set up CI/CD (optional)

1. Generate a **project token** (required for `railway up` in CI): open your **ducky project** in Railway → **Project Settings** (gear or project menu) → **Tokens** → create a token for the environment you deploy to (e.g. production).
2. Add it as `RAILWAY_TOKEN` in your GitHub repo → **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**.
3. Push to `master` — `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` will automatically deploy all three services.

**Note:** Use a **project token** from the project’s Settings → Tokens, not an account token from Account → Tokens. The CLI uses `RAILWAY_TOKEN` for deployments and expects a project-scoped token.

**Service names:** With Railway’s GitHub integration, services are named after the package names: `@ducky/server`, `@ducky/web-backend`, `@ducky/web-frontend`. The workflow uses these by default. To override (e.g. with custom names or service IDs), set Actions **Variables** `RAILWAY_SERVICE_TUNNEL_SERVER`, `RAILWAY_SERVICE_WEB_BACKEND`, `RAILWAY_SERVICE_WEB_FRONTEND`.

**If GitHub is green but nothing deploys on Railway:**

1. **Dockerfile and root directory** — In Railway, each of the three services must use the correct Dockerfile and **Root directory must be empty** (build context = repo root). Set **Dockerfile path** per the table in Step 3 (`Dockerfile`, `Dockerfile.web-backend`, `Dockerfile.web-frontend`).
2. **Project token environment** — The project token must be for the **environment** where those three services live (e.g. Production). Create the token in that environment’s context.
3. **Workflow now uses `--ci`** — The deploy job runs `railway up --ci` so it waits for the Railway build to finish. If the build fails on Railway, the workflow will fail in GitHub and you’ll see the build logs in the Actions run. If it still passes but no deploy appears, check the same service in the Railway dashboard (Deployments tab) for failed or cancelled builds.
4. **“Cannot find module '@ducky/shared'” or “No workspaces found”** — The Dockerfiles use an explicit build order (and the frontend builds standalone). If you still see these errors, clear Railway’s build cache: in each service → **Settings** → **Build** (or **Deploy**) → **Clear build cache** (or redeploy with cache disabled), then redeploy.
5. **"No change detected" / Railway skips build** — Each Dockerfile has a `BUILD_REV` build arg. In Railway, add a variable **BUILD_REV** (e.g. set to the git commit SHA or any new value) and redeploy so the build runs. You can also use **Redeploy** with **Clear build cache**, or set **NO_CACHE=1** as an env var, to force a full rebuild.
6. **"No changes to watched files"** — Railway only deploys when changed files match **Watch Paths**. In each service go to **Settings** → **Build** → **Watch Paths**. Either leave it **empty** (so any push triggers a deploy) or add patterns from repo root, e.g. `Dockerfile*`, `package.json`, `packages/**`.
